    <h2>Erin Stewart</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Erin. I've been married to my husband for eleven years. We have two children together. I love spending any sort of quality time with my family and friends. I also love playing games, doing puzzles, reading, cooking, baking, and going on adventures.</p>
    <p>I'm pursing a BS with a major in Family History Research and a minor in Web and Computer Programming. I love both fields of study and I hope to combine them in a future career. Originally, my goal was to become a professional genealogist. However, I've loved coding so much that I now hope computers will play a big role in my career. I'm excited to learn about the possibilities of web design.</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is from the Sermon on the Mount, in 3 Nephi 13:30-34. Jesus taught to "seek ye first the kingdom of God". Those words specifically came as an answer to my prayers a few years ago. They brought immense comfort and clarity to my life. I ponder them often.</p>
