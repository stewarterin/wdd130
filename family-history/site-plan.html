        Getting Started
      </p>
      <p>
        1. You can start your very own family tree through FamilySearch. To do so, you’ll need an account. You can create an account here: Create an Account (https://www.familysearch.org/identity/signup/)
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Now that you have an account, you can begin building your tree. Visit this page to learn how to start adding people to your tree: Build Your Tree (https://www.familysearch.org/en/blog/how-to-start-a-family-tree)
      </p>
      <p>
        3. FamilySearch Family Tree is the largest online collaborative family tree. When getting started, it’s important to note that your tree won’t connect to the globally shared Family Tree until you add a deceased ancestor’s profile. You can learn more about ID numbers and living versus deceased profiles here: ID Numbers (https://www.familysearch.org/en/help/helpcenter/article/what-are-id-numbers-used-for-in-family-tree)
      </p>
      <p>
        4. You may want to connect to a spouse’s family tree. Just as with your own tree, you won’t connect to the shared Family Tree until you add a deceased individual’s profile. Learn more about connecting to a spouse’s tree here: Connecting Trees (https://www.familysearch.org/en/blog/how-to-connect-to-a-family-members-tree)

      </ul>
      <h3>Interview</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever wished you could interview a deceased ancestor? In this life, we may not have the chance to do so face-to-face, but we can still tell their stories. Even if they didn’t leave behind diaries or many personal records, compiling the facts can create a sense of who they were and what their lives were like.
      </p>
      <p>
        A life sketch is a great way to tell an ancestor’s story in an approachable and meaningful way. By writing a life sketch you can summarize the key points of a life. Even when little is known about an ancestor, writing what you do know in narrative form can bring their story to life! 
      </p>
      <p>
        To write a life sketch, you’ll want to share a good amount of information about the person. However, it’s important to remember that you’re not writing a full biography. So, focus on key events to give a good overview and feel of what their life was like. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What to include (if possible):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Birth information</li>
        <li>Parent's names</li>
        <li>Sibling's names</li>
        <li>Career information</li>
        <li>Residence locations</li>
        <li>Movements, migrations, immigrations, etc.</li>
        <li>Marriage information</li>
        <li>The birth of children</li>
        <li>Other big events, such as military service</li>
        <li>Death information</li>
        <li>Anything else substantial about their life story</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tips for writing a successful life sketch:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep it short. You don’t need to include all the details.</li>
        <li>Write in chronological order. Include the events in the order that they really happened.</li>
        <li>Write in a third-person narrative. Use words like he, she, and they.</li>
        <li>Don’t speculate. Don’t add your own personal commentary.</li>
        <li>Focus on the subject of the life sketch as much as possible. Don’t write about their family members’ lives the whole time.</li>
        <li>Use action verbs to engage the reader.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Lastly, share the life sketch with living family members. Doing so can help you connect with each other and with your common ancestor.
