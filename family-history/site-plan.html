      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will contain quick information about getting started with family history. The page will answer common questions and provide links 
        to Family Search where appropriate. Most of the provided information for this page is readily available on Family Search, but the page will be 
        customized to the ward and its needs. Another benefit is that all the links will be housed in one easy to access place. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be information about how to get started with Family Search and how to create a family tree. There will also be information about how to 
        link to a spouse’s tree. There will be information about the difference between a living person’s profile and a deceased person’s profile. There 
        will be information about affiliate partnerships offered through Family Search. There will be information about how to share your tree using your 
        helper number. There will be information about making family history fun using Family Search’s activities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At the bottom of the home page, there will be a sentence or two encouraging ward members to reach out for more help through the connect page. The 
        webpage will strive to help ward members feel that they can be involved in family history even if they aren’t or don’t want to be a professional 
        genealogist. I hope that the information provided will remove some of the intimidation that people can feel around geneaology. 
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Interview</h3>
      <p>
        The interview page will share information about how ward members can  “interview” deceased ancestors. The page will provide details explaining how 
        to tell an ancestor’s story, even if they didn’t leave behind diaries or many personal records. There will be an article that I wrote about how to 
        write life sketches for any ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another feature of the interview page will be a list of sample questions to “ask” an ancestor. The list will contain questions about various 
        topics, such as career, military service, children, residence, religion, etc. The purpose of this page is to help ward members create connections 
        with their ancestors. I hope this page will inspire ward members to see how they can connect with their ancestors, even if they never met them in 
        this life.

      </ul>
      <h3>Connect</h3>
      <p>
        The connect page will be a place for ward members to ask questions and share information. The connect page will be a place for ward members 
        to ask questions and share information. Currently, there will be three opportunities for connecting. First, ward members will be able to ask 
        their family history questions. The ward’s family history consultants will work to answer the questions and share those answers. Second, ward 
        members can submit their family history experiences and testimonies. In the future, the shared experiences and testimonies will be compiled 
        onto another page of the website. Third, ward members will work together to compile a list of family history ideas. The purpose of this list 
        is to inspire the ward to find ways that they would like to be involved in family history. Currently, there will be three opportunities for 
        connecting. First, ward members will be able to ask their family history questions. The ward’s family history consultants will work to answer

        of family history ideas. The purpose of this list is to inspire the ward to find ways that they would like to be involved in family history. 
        The idea list will also be compiled onto another page of the website in the future. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the connect page, I hope to create an environment in which family history conversations will thrive among ward members. Sometimes, family 
        history work can feel like a lone activity. However, it’s always more fun when you can share your family history experiences. Hopefully, ward members 
        will feel a sense of joy and excitement about family history as they connect with one another. I also hope that the connect page will provide a safe 
        space where ward members can feel comfortable asking their questions, no matter how experienced or inexperienced they are.
