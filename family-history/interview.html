                <p>Have you ever wished you could interview a deceased ancestor? In this life, we may not have the chance to do so face-to-face, but we can still tell their stories. Even if they didn’t leave behind diaries or many personal records, compiling the facts can create a sense of who they were and what their lives were like.</p>
                <p>A life sketch is a great way to tell an ancestor’s story in an approachable and meaningful way. By writing a life sketch you can summarize the key points of a life. Even when little is known about an ancestor, writing what you do know in narrative form can bring their story to life!</p>
                <p>To write a life sketch, you’ll want to share a good amount of information about the person. However, it’s important to remember that you’re not writing a full biography. So, focus on key events to give a good overview and feel of what their life was like.</p>

                <p>Tips for writing a successful life sketch:</p>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it short. You don’t need to include all the details.</li>
                    <li>Write in chronological order. Include the events in the order that they really happened.</li>
                    <li>Write in a third-person narrative. Use words like he, she, and they.</li>
                    <li>Don’t speculate. Don’t add your own personal commentary.</li>
                    <li>Focus on the subject of the life sketch as much as possible. Don’t write about their family members’ lives the whole time.</li>
                    <li>Use action verbs to engage the reader.</li>
                </ul>

            <div id="fourth_section">
                <p>Lastly, share the life sketch with living family members. Doing so can help you connect with each other and with your common ancestor.</p>
